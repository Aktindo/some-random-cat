## About

I saw that there were not many good packages for generating random stuff. So I decided to make one.   
A very suitable API to generate random images of cats, dogs and random jokes, facts... A lot more!

## Why?

* Object-oriented
* Speedy and efficient
* Feature-rich
* Easy
* Beginner-Friendly
* Flexible

## Example

Generate a random cat image:

```javascript
const somethingRandom = require('some-random-cat')
const Random = new somethingRandom()
Random.newCat()
.then(res => console.log(res)) // The function returns a pending promise and can be logged using .then
.catch(e => console.error(e)) // Catch the error
```
