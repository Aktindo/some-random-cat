# Reading Notation

Throughout the whole `SomeRandomCat` documentation or in the support server, you may see notation very often. To help you understand those, we will be going over a few common types of them.

{% hint style="success" %}
Always keep in mind that notation is not always rigorous. There will be typos, misunderstandings, or context that will cause notation to differ from the usual meanings.

## Classes

Some common notations are used to refer to a class or the properties, methods, or events of a class. There are many variations on these notations, and they are very flexible depending on the person, so use your best judgement when reading them. For example, if you are given a text `<Random>`, it means an instance of the class Random. It is telling you to replace it with your own instance that you have made, but in our case, it is `STATIC` which means there is no hustle and bustle of instantiating it. 

The notation `Class#foo` refers to a property called foo in the class `Class`. However in the case of `STATIC` properties you write it as `Class.foo`

To write an event, you can write it as `<Class>#<property>:<event>`

{% hint style="warning" %}
Remember that this notation is not valid JavaScript, it is a shorthand to refer to a certain piece of code.
