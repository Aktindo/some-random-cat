## Installation

To install the package, you would have to make sure that node.js is installed on your machine. After that, you can simply do `npm i some-random-cat` in the terminal where you want to install the package or `npm i some-random-cat -g` to install it globally.

## About

I saw that there were not many good packages for generating random stuff. So I decided to make one.  
A very suitable API to generate random images of cats, dogs and random jokes, facts... A lot more!

## Why?

* Object-oriented
* Speedy and efficient
* Feature-rich
* Easy
* Beginner-Friendly
* Flexible

## Example

Generate a random cat image:

```javascript
const somethingRandom = require('some-random-cat').Random //Import the package
somethingRandom.getCat()
.then(res => {
    console.log(res)
    return
}) // Get the result
.catch(e => {
    console.error(e)
    return
}) // Catch the error
```
